# Hi, my name is Aishat.

## This project is a "Mesto" website.

**Intro**

This site is dedicated to the most beautiful places in Russia and beyond.
It is interactive, convenient and even useful: you can not only choose places to travel, but add your own so that other people can learn more about them and visit them.
On this site you can add interesting places, photos and short descriptions.

**about technology**

This is a simple and informative site. It is fully responsive and responsive for most popular devices. It uses HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript. The arrangement of elements was implemented using Flex technology, so it will not be difficult to adapt to new devices. It uses only a few fonts and colors. However, the site is tasteful, organic and friendly looking.

Thank you for watching.
